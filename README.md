This was a solo project where I created a website that would allow users to upload photos of puppies and rank them based on cuteness. Afterward, the users can view the rankings and MMR ranking of each puppy submitted into the system.

Users are Initially prompted with a start screen

Afterwards they are brought to "battle screen where they can choose which dog is cuter.

When the user is done playing, they can then click on the Historical Rankings button that brings up the current rankings of the puppies with their MMR ranking.

I used React to create the front end of the website, and MongoDB as the database to store the website's information. I used the MongoDB package gridfs to allow image file uploads to MongoDB database and this was a great experience in learning new packages and applying them to my own projects.

In the future, I would like to improve the website design and deploy this website to AWS.

Technologies used: React, React Router, ExpressJS, MongoDB, webpack
